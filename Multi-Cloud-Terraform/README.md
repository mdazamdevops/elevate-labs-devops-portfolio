## Multi-Cloud Auto Deployment using Terraform (AWS + GCP Free Tier)
* Elevate Labs: Empowering the Future of DevOps
This project is a testament to the high-quality, hands-on learning experience provided by Elevate Labs. Their internship program is dedicated to empowering the next generation of DevOps professionals by offering practical, real-world challenges that build foundational skills and a deep understanding of modern software development practices.

## Project Overview
Objective: Provision resources in both AWS and GCP simultaneously and validate auto-deployment with a single command using Terraform infrastructure as code.

Tools: Terraform, AWS Free Tier, GCP Free Tier, NGINX, DNSMasq (local)

## Features
* Multi-Cloud Deployment: Simultaneous provisioning on AWS and GCP
* Free Tier Compliance: Uses only free-tier eligible resources
* Automated Deployment: Single command setup (terraform apply)
* Health Checks: Automatic validation of both cloud deployments

## Infrastructure as Code: Complete Terraform configuration

* QR Scanner Application: Ready-to-deploy web application
* Prerequisites
  Tools Required
  Terraform (>= 1.0)

* AWS CLI (configured with credentials)

* Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)
Git

## Accounts Required
AWS Account with Free Tier eligibility

Google Cloud Platform Account

## SSH Key Pair
* Installation & Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd multi-cloud-qr-scanner
2. Configure Cloud Credentials
AWS Configuration:

```
aws configure
# Enter AWS Access Key, Secret Key, Region: ap-south-1
GCP Configuration:

```
* gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
## 3. Set Up Terraform Variables
```
# Create terraform.tfvars file
cat > terraform.tfvars << EOF
gcp_project_id = "your-gcp-project-id"
ssh_public_key = "ssh-rsa your-public-key-content"
EOF
4. Initialize Terraform
bash
terraform init
ðŸš€ Deployment
Single Command Deployment
```
* terraform apply -auto-approve
Manual Approval Deployment
```
```
terraform plan    # Review changes
terraform apply   # Confirm deployment
âœ… Validation Steps
After deployment, validate using:
## 1. Check Outputs
```
terraform output
# Should display both AWS and GCP instance IPs
```
## 2. Test Application Access
### Test AWS instance
curl http://$(terraform output -raw aws_instance_ip)
```
# Test GCP instance  
curl http://$(terraform output -raw gcp_instance_ip)
```
## 3. Health Check Automation
The deployment includes automatic health checks that verify:

Both instances are reachable via HTTP
NGINX is serving the QR scanner application
Cloud resources are properly configured

## 4. Cloud Console Verification
AWS Console Checks:
* EC2 Instance running (t2.micro)
Elastic IP assigned
Security group with proper rules
VPC and networking configured
GCP Console Checks:
Compute Engine instance running (f1-micro)
External IP assigned
Default network utilized
Firewall rules effective
---
## Cleanup
To destroy all resources and avoid charges:

```
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
## Troubleshooting
Common Issues
GCP Permission Errors: Ensure service account has Compute Admin role

AWS Key Pair Exists: Delete existing key pair or use different name

Image Not Found: Use correct Ubuntu image family for GCP

Authentication Issues: Verify both AWS and GCP credentials

Debug Commands
```
# Verify AWS configuration
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify GCP configuration  
gcloud auth list
gcloud config get-value project

# Check Terraform state
terraform state list
```
